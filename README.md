# Countdown

This program is a solver of a Countdown number game variant in which a valid solution must use all the tiles once.

How to run the program (example):

ruby countdown.rb 952 25 50 75 100 3 6

Will try to find 952 using tiles 25, 50, 75, 100, 3 and 6 and the four arithmetic operators: addition, multiplication, subtraction and integer division. All the arguments must be positive integers.

The program will search for all solutions and will print the number of nodes (search tree size) and solutions found at the end of execution.
